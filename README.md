# Master's degree thesis 

This repository contains my master's degree thesis (in Italian) for my degree in Computer Science and engineering at the University of Verona, with the title "Automating acceptance tests for embedded IoT devices integrated with the cloud". 

It describes a test system that was developed to automated acceptance tests on embedded IoT devices, with a case study of an electric radiator developed for IRSAP s.p.a.

The particularity of this thesis is that the software is tested on the real hardware, trough a test fixture that simulates inputs/read outputs, and also communicates with the device trough the cloud server.
